## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shaobangzhu/daytrade-framework.git
cd daytrade-framework
```

### 2. Setup Backend

```bash
cd backend-project
npm install
npm run start
```

- Runs at: `http://localhost:7001`
- Available Endpoints:
  - `POST /api/login`
  - `GET /api/logout`
  - `GET /api/isLogin`
  - `GET /api/getData`
  - `GET /api/showData`

### 3. Setup Frontend

```bash
cd backend-project
npm install
npm run start
```

- Runs at: `http://localhost:3000`
- Pages:
  - `/login` ‚Äî Login form
  - `/` ‚Äî Home page with chart and data actions

---

## üìÅ Data File
Stock data is saved to:
backend-project/data/prices.json

use Node.js‚Äôs path module to resolve the path dynamically:

```bash
import path from 'path';

const filePath = path.resolve(__dirname, '../data/prices.json');

```
This approach works safely across:
- ‚úÖ Windows
- ‚úÖ macOS
- ‚úÖ Linux
- ‚úÖ Varying directory structures

- [ ] Add user registration
- [ ] Save user watchlists
