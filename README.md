## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shaobangzhu/daytrade-framework.git
cd daytrade-framework
```

### 2. Setup Backend

```bash
cd backend-project
npm install
npm run start
```

- Runs at: `http://localhost:7001`
- Available Endpoints:
  - `POST /api/login`
  - `GET /api/logout`
  - `GET /api/isLogin`
  - `GET /api/getData`
  - `GET /api/showData`

### 3. Setup Frontend

```bash
cd backend-project
npm install
npm run start
```

- Runs at: `http://localhost:3000`
- Pages:
  - `/login` — Login form
  - `/` — Home page with chart and data actions

---

## 📁 Data File
Stock data is saved to:
backend-project/data/prices.json

use Node.js’s path module to resolve the path dynamically:

```bash
import path from 'path';

const filePath = path.resolve(__dirname, '../data/prices.json');

```
This approach works safely across:
- ✅ Windows
- ✅ macOS
- ✅ Linux
- ✅ Varying directory structures

---

## 📌 TODO
- [ ] Add user registration
- [ ] Save user watchlists
- [ ] Store data in a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB)
- [ ] Implement trading strategy editor
